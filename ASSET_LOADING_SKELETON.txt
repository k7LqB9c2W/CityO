CityG Asset Loading Skeleton (Step 5)

Asset catalog
- Asset manifests live in files named asset.json under the assets root.
- Required JSON fields: version, id, type, mesh.
- Optional fields: category, defaultScale, footprintM, pivotM, tags.
- AssetId is a stable FNV-1a 32-bit hash of id.
- Default mapping: category low_density -> buildings.house_low_01.
- Fallback asset: builtin.cube_house (used when missing).

Building instances
- CPU data uses BuildingInstance { AssetId asset, localPos, yaw, scale, seed }.
- AppState.buildingChunks stores instances grouped by chunk and asset.
- Renderer draws one instanced batch per (chunk, asset) so meshes can differ.
- Animated houses still use the cube instanced path for now.

Mesh cache
- MeshCache holds GPU meshes and a fallback cube.
- glTF loading is optional and on-demand (first visible use of an asset).
- MeshRelPath is resolved relative to the assets root.
- If loading fails, the fallback cube mesh is used.

Save format
- save.json includes assetIdToString for debugging and future-proofing.
