• Enabled multi‑cell building footprints by validating each building’s full footprint against the zone grid, so larger
  buildings can span multiple 8m tiles without touching lot density.

  - src/main.cpp: added ZoneRectTypeCoverage and used it in RebuildHousesFromLots with cell‑aligned footprints; removed
    the hard 16m/48m lot size gate and now gate on actual footprint coverage instead.

  Important limitation: a footprint deeper than the zone band still won’t spawn (zone depth is 48m from ZONE_DEPTH_CELLS
  = 6). So 100m‑deep buildings still fail unless you deepen zoning or treat them as special cases.

  If you want next steps:

  1. I can add a “large footprint” path that merges multiple zoned rows to allow deeper buildings (by increasing
     ZONE_DEPTH_CELLS or adding a separate large‑lot placement rule).
  2. I can add a debug overlay to visualize footprint coverage and why a placement was rejected.
